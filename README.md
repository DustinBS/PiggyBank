# PiggyBank
PiggyBank is an Android budgeting app that stores user data through Google Firebase. We developed it as the final project for the Android Development class at EdCC.

**Details**:

This is an Android application that will track the user makes or spends the money, the amount of money as well as the type of money - whether it is income or expense. If it is an expense, the app will also save the categories on which they spend on. Aside from the money details, the app stores the category information as well as the number of expenses, profits, and show those statistics in a pie chart. Categories can also be added, edited, and deleted by the user. The data of a user is stored in Google FireBase.

Minimum API level: 21
